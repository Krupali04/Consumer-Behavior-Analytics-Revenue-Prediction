# Consumer-Behavior-Analytics-Revenue-Prediction

## Project Overview

This project involves an end-to-end workflow, starting from data preparation to model evaluation and optimization. The goal is to analyze customer purchasing behavior and predict future sales using advanced machine learning techniques.

## Key Highlights

## Data Preparation:

Merging Datasets: Combined multiple datasets to create a cohesive dataset for analysis.

Data Cleaning: Identified and handled missing values by replacing them with appropriate strategies (e.g., mean, median, or mode).

Feature Analysis:
Explored and analyzed categorical features (e.g., gender, age group, product category).
Examined numerical features (e.g., purchase amounts) for trends and patterns.

## Data Visualization:

Created insightful visualizations to uncover relationships between features and sales behavior.

Used visual analysis to guide feature engineering and hypothesis generation.

## Preprocessing for Machine Learning:

Data Splitting: Divided the data into training and test sets.

Standardization: Applied feature scaling to ensure consistent input for the model.

## Model Development:

Random Forest Regressor: Trained a robust ensemble model to predict sales values.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized model performance using GridSearchCV for parameter tuning.

## Evaluation:
Assessed model accuracy and performance using evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, RÂ²).
